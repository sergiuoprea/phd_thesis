\emph{I want to thank the Government of Spain (grant programs FPU15/04516, DPI2013-40534-R, TIN2016-76515-R, GV/2018/022) for funding these years of research, internships and attendances to international conferences. I also gratefully acknowledge the support of NVIDIA Corporation with the donation of hardware used for this research.}\\

%\chapter{Disacknowledgements}

%This brief paragraph here is a reflection originally written by my colleague Mariano Jaimez Tarifa. It is a thought that I believe captures to perfection the feelings of every single researcher in Spain. Let this "disacknowledgement" serve as a way to raise awareness about our despicable political leaders and the rottenness of an education system full of incompetent and dishonest professors.

%\emph{"The Government of Spain has invested a significant sum of money in this thesis during a period when the Spanish economy was in crisis. Unfortunately this investment is not going to be profitable for the Spanish State because the lack of a powerful technological industry in our country pushes me to seek for jobs abroad. I sincerely feel this is a pitty and a detrimental situation for Spain but it is not in my hands to change it. The Spanish government should promote a much tighter collaboration between companies and researchers in order to avoid this. How to do that in an efficient way is beyond my knowledge, but it might be worth thinking about all the work developed by hundreds of PhD students which falls into oblivion after they finish. I believe that huge amount of effort deserves a better fate."}
